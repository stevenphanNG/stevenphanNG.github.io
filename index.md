### CPSC 120

*Lab 7

Lab 7 was my favorite lab in the series because I have always wondered how the C++ function could be calculated. To calculate the correct value of a Julian day, it was the first time I could write functions that did so.

*Lab 6

It has been quite a while since I have used Lab 6, part 2 of that lab, which is also one of my favorite labs of this semester since I have always been curious about how Guessing Games work, and this has been the first time I have been able to create the program myself and make sense of how it works. It took me more than two days to complete.

*Lab 11

Lab 11, part 2 was also one of my favorite labs in this class this semester. Learning to create random numbers in the game took work for me at first. It took me some time to know what to do, and I also needed help from the TA. However, after completing the lab, I understood more about how the game and the function work.
